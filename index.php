			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p> Hi my name is Matt David. I am growing my coding and team development skills to combine my
                Electrical licence because of my interest in electronics and device programmer. I'm building a solid
                coding foundation with good habits to be a valued developer. Does your company program electronics
                and devices?</p>

		<h2>Reflections</h2>

			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>What to think!!! I'm in a totally different world. I'm not sure what to make of it right now. My
			biggest challenges are not with code itself or the learning style but getting used to the environment it
				happens in. I'm used to having multiple problems a day. When a problem presents itself I must handle it
				quickly and efficiently so I may travel to the next issue on my plate. Everything in the world I'm used to
				has hard and fast deadlines.
			No excuse is acceptable and to have any problem for an extended period of time would be detrimental to
			your job and future. I'm used to having a problem that I can touch and manipulate. Doing actions by
			giving commands to a piece of technology is a brand new concept for me. Don't get me wrong, I am no
			stranger to typing a paper or making a small add. I'm frequently cruising the internet as many in this
			day and age do but until recently I have not had a purpose for a computer in my life. The ailments of
			my usual world are cuts, calluses, and bruises. The activities are to build and do. This new world is
			different. The biggest pain is headache! The activities are to dream and create! I know at this moment I
			have very little skill in this unfamiliar place but I am more than capable of learning anything in this
			world with proper effort. I will have to work harder than most in my class to gain the knowledge that
			some already seem versed in but I know I will not give up. I will make a place for myself in this new
			adventure. It is the most pleasant way I have spent a normal work day I can remember. I'm excited to see
			what is to come.</p>

            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <p>Well here I am still making things happen. I don't always know what I'm doind or why I'm doing it but it
                seems I'm accomplishing assignments. My original prediction of having to work harder than most to get
                things done is holding true. I even shot myself in the foot by not knowing where to stop during the
                data design project. I did an extra 200 lines of code and an hour of attempting to figure out how to
                apply the knowledge from he first page to the two remaining. What a way to spend a Saturday!! Its great
                knowing that I won't be one of those who are following the usual "learning how to code" curve. I
                started knowing that I didn't know anything about coding so its kind of hard to go any lower than rock
                bottom. It already actually feels like I'm on the up slope of the curve if anything because the more I
                listen, attempt, and accomplish the more confident I'm becoming. I really enjoy being able to get
                involved in the coding part. I am aware that we aren't even doing anything fun yet and I'm already
                excited to wake up and get to the keyboard. I'm still excited to see what is to come</p>

            <h3>Matthew J David Search</h3>
            <p>Well it took me almost no time at all to find that I have extremely little presence online. On
                Whitepages it even gives a range for me age. To me thats funny. As far as my future, I think its good
                and bad. I have a clean slate to make what ever type of presence I would like. On the other hand I have
                a blank slate, no history, no experience. I will have to make a greater effort to have a positive
                presence that stands out.</p>

            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p>Ok so its a little early to tell yet and I'm not ready to admit that I may enjoy front end much better
            than back end. Maybe its the approach we have taken. Maybe I wasn't paying attention. I feel much more
            comfortable when I can write some code and see an immediate result. This pleases me, lol. I'm going to
            try to have as much hand in data design in the capstone as to understand it better, but for now css and
            front end works well for me.</p>

            <h3>Market Initiative</h3>
            <p>So I took a few different initiatives this weekend. I decided to take the direct approach. I know
            multiple business owners. It ranges from one man operations to multi location incs. I asked directly to
            a few of these businesses. I was much more successful with small business as far as engaging
            conversation goes. They were much more receptive to the idea of me creating an online presence. Larger
            business, with established web presence was not so receptive to having someone with my limited skillset
            work on their page.</p>
            <p>So the indirect approach I took was easy but not terribly successful. I overheard a conversation
            between two people about needing some sort of web presence. They didn't have much to spend and couldn't
            find someone willing to do the work for an affordable price. I simply walked by when I picked up my food
            and said, "I develop websites for small business if you are interested." I just walked away after, went and
            sat down with my food and they happily picked up their food and moved to my table as if I had invited them
            to a business meeting. The ideas that came from the talk that followed led to an exchange of information
            so they can contact me at a time that they wanted to tackle the project. Thank goodness because I totally
            couldn't fulfill the objectives that I proposed yet. I will, but not yet.</p>

            <h3>Team Game Reflection</h3>
                <h4>Zach</h4>
            <p>weakness- I think Zach only has one weakness. It can be taken two ways. It could be that he
            lacks confidence in his own opinion. I suspect more it is that he doesn't want to hurt anyones
            feelings and wants everyone to feel important.</p>
            <p>Strengths- I think Zach is a great analytical thinker. He is very strategic with his responses
            and opinions. I feel like Zach is intelligent and a strong team player. I'm thankful for Zach to be on the
            team.</p>

                <h4>Luther</h4>
            <p>Weaknesses- probably communication. I think Luther has to work a little harder than some at explaining
            whats in his head</p>
            <p>Strength- his creativity and foresight! I really like his ideas and how he plans for the future. I am
            thankful to have Luther on the team</p>

                <h4>Chris</h4>
            <p>Weakness- inexperience, attention to detail, confidence.</p>
            <p>Strengths- creativity and communication. Awesome ideas. Doesn't have limits on his dreams. Really good
            at communication whats in his head. Im happy to have Chris on the team</p>

                <h4>Me</h4>
            <p>Weaknesses- patience, close minded, tunnel vision</p>
            <p>Strengths- logic, communication (sometimes overly so)</p>

                <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>I think our team is fairly complimentary to each other. As far as our differences go, everyone seems open
            minded enough to be able to overcome most obstacles. I felt like everyone was trying to play fair and
            for the success of the team. Nobody argued. Nobody cut corners. We even overcame an outside obstacle. We
            had a visitor that desperately wanted to be part of our decision making process and wasn't following the
            rules. Our team politely addressed him and his comments and continued to make our best calibrated moves.
            We were not successful in making it off the island but it was still fun.</p>
