		<h2>Reflections</h2>

			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>What to think!!! I'm in a totally different world. I'm not sure what to make of it right now. My
			biggest challenges are not with code itself or the learning style but getting used to the environment it
				happens in. I'm used to having multiple problems a day. When a problem presents itself I must handle it
				quickly and efficiently so I may travel to the next issue on my plate. Everything in the world I'm used to
				has hard and fast deadlines.
			No excuse is acceptable and to have any problem for an extended period of time would be detrimental to
			your job and future. I'm used to having a problem that I can touch and manipulate. Doing actions by
			giving commands to a piece of technology is a brand new concept for me. Don't get me wrong, I am no
			stranger to typing a paper or making a small add. I'm frequently cruising the internet as many in this
			day and age do but until recently I have not had a purpose for a computer in my life. The ailments of
			my usual world are cuts, calluses, and bruises. The activities are to build and do. This new world is
			different. The biggest pain is headache! The activities are to dream and create! I know at this moment I
			have very little skill in this unfamiliar place but I am more than capable of learning anything in this
			world with proper effort. I will have to work harder than most in my class to gain the knowledge that
			some already seem versed in but I know I will not give up. I will make a place for myself in this new
			adventure. It is the most pleasant way I have spent a normal work day I can remember. I'm excited to see
			what is to come.</p>
